# Adaptation to stimulus mean and variance

Change into the `meanvariance/` directory and run
``` sh
python3 meanvariance.py
```
for a demo.

In the following, key concepts of adaptation to the mean, computation
of the amplitude modulation, and adaptation to the variance, as well
as the respective code are briefly described. See the
[`meanvariance.py`](meanvariance.py) script for the full functions.


## Adaptation to the mean

Let's generate a stimulus with stepwise different mean values. For
this we generate a longer white-noise stimulus and the add to
differenent segments of the stimulus different numbers.
