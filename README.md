# Neural Adaptation Primer


## Requirements

The `python` scripts run in python version 3, using the following packages:

- numpy
- scipy >= 1.2.0
- matplotlib >= 2.2.0


## Leaky integrate-and-fire with adaptation current

The leaky integrate-and-fire model is a simple model of a spiking
neuron. Augmented with a generic adaptation current it reproduces many
features of intrinsically adapting neurons. [Read more.](lifac/README.md)


## Firing rate models

Spike-frequency adaptation is a phenomenon of the spike
frequency. Modeling adaptation on the level of spike freuqencies is
thus a natural choice. [Read more.](sfa/README.md)
