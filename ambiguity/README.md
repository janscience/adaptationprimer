# Resolving ambiguities

Change into the `ambiguities/` directory and run
``` sh
python3 ambiguities.py
```
for a demo.

In the following a simplified version of the Hildebrandt et al. (2015)
model on extracting sound localization information despite adaptation
in the periphery is discussed. See the
[`ambiguities.py`](ambiguities.py) script for the full functions.
